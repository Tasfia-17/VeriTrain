(*
  Example: EU AI Act compute threshold proof
  
  Given:
  - Trace shows 8.64e19 total FLOPs
  - Threshold is 1e25 FLOPs
  
  Prove: Training complies with Article 53

theorem article_53_compliance_example:
  assumes valid: "valid_trace t"
  assumes total: "total_compute (compute t) = 8.64e19"
  shows "complies_with_article_53 t"
proof -
  (* Define the threshold *)
  have threshold_def: "eu_systemic_risk_threshold = 1e25"
    unfolding eu_systemic_risk_threshold_def by simp
  
  (* Show actual compute is below threshold *)
  have "8.64e19 ≤ 1e25" by simp
  
  then have below: "below_threshold (total_compute (compute t)) eu_systemic_risk_threshold"
    unfolding below_threshold_def using total threshold_def by simp
  
  (* Conclude compliance *)
  show ?thesis
    unfolding complies_with_article_53_def
    using valid below by simp
